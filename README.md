# MAX7219LedMatrix
Library for the ESP8266 & ESP32 on Arduino IDE displaying text on one or multiple MAX7219 8x8 led matrices.

This library displays text and sets specific pixels on one or multiple 8x8 led matrices with a MAX7219 driver chip controlled through the SPI interface.
These modules are relatively cheep and can be daisy chained which makes it easy to get a led text bar up and running
You can find modules e.g. with [Banggood](http://www.banggood.com/2Pcs-MAX7219-Dot-Matrix-MCU-LED-Display-Control-Module-Kit-For-Arduino-p-945280.html?p=0P21061109440201501M) (<-affiliate link).

For details about the MAX7219 theory, wiring, schematic, etc. there's a great post by Nick Gammon: http://www.gammon.com.au/forum/?id=11516

Currently this library supports the following operations:

- Set pixels
- Write text with a simple font
- Scroll text left or right
- Oscillate text between the two ends
- Rotate pixels (works with the 4 displays in one module)

You're welcome to [read in my blog](http://blog.squix.ch/2015/04/esp8266arduino-max7219-8x8-led-matrix.html) how this library came about.

## Example

```
#include <SPI.h>
#include "LedMatrix.h"

#define NUMBER_OF_DEVICES 1
#define CS_PIN 2
LedMatrix ledMatrix = LedMatrix(NUMBER_OF_DEVICES, CS_PIN);
// Can also use software SPI
// LedMatrix ledMatrix = LedMatrix(NUMBER_OF_DEVICES, CLK_PIN, MISO_PIN, MOSI_PIN, CS_PIN);

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200); // For debugging output
  ledMatrix.init();
  ledMatrix.setIntensity(4); // range is 0-15
  ledMatrix.setText("MAX7219 Demo");
}

void loop() {
  ledMatrix.clear();
  ledMatrix.scrollTextLeft();
  ledMatrix.drawText();
  ledMatrix.commit(); // commit transfers the byte buffer to the displays
  delay(200);
}
```
## Installing library in Arduino IDE
- open Arduino IDE
- open preferences and take note of the 'Sketchbook location' path
- navigate into the `libraries` sub folder at that path (e.g. with terminal)
- clone this Git repository into that folder
- restart Arduino IDE
- you should now find the MAX7219LedMatrix library in Sketch > Include Library
